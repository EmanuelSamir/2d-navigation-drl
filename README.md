# 2d Navigation using DRL
This repository is in constant change. Main branch contains the necessary files to implement a 2d-navigation task in an unstructured environment. We tested this work in an own simulated environment available with integration with Open AI Gym tools in the repositories [simulation](https://github.com/EmanuelSamir/simple-2d-robot-lidar) and [gym environment](https://github.com/EmanuelSamir/simple-2d-robot-lidar-env).
